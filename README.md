# Gesture Weight Smoothing
Tool for smoothing Gesture Weight parameters for VRChat avatars.

## Description
This tool applies [GestureWeight transition correction](https://docs.hai-vr.dev/docs/products/combo-gesture-expressions/additional-pages/corrections#gestureweight-transition-correction) and [GestureWeight smoothing correction](https://docs.hai-vr.dev/docs/products/combo-gesture-expressions/additional-pages/corrections#gestureweight-smoothing-correction) to your avatar by adding AnimatorControllerLayers generated by HaÃ¯~'s [ComboGestureExpressions](https://docs.hai-vr.dev/docs/products/combo-gesture-expressions) and replacing GestureWeight parameters.

## How to use
Add one of the Prefabs in the `Packages > Gesture Weight Smoothing > Assets > Prefabs` folder to your avatar.

- `ListenWhileFist` Prefab
  - Use this if your AnimatorControllers see GestureWeight parameters only while Fist.
  - If the Fist and Idle states are separated, this is probably the case.

- `ListenWhileFistAndIdle` Prefab
  - Use this if your AnimatorControllers see GestureWeight parameters while Idle as well as Fist.
  - If the Fist and Idle states are shared, this is probably the case.
